- 👋 Hi, I’m @Maxthemaker8
- 👀 I’m interested in ... landing a junior developer position this year.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... the basics (HTML, CSS, and JS) as well as the MERN stack. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything interesting. Projects for my portfolio. I've mostly got the basics down but am always learning/refreshing to strengthen my foundation.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Maxthemaker8@gmail.com
